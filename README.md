AR ECO PARK
AIM

         This project aims to create a marker-based augmented reality (AR) app that enables users to scan specific markers located within an eco-park or in educational materials. Scanning these markers with their device’s camera triggers detailed, interactive 3D models and information about various plant species, animals, and eco-friendly installations. This app is designed to enhance environmental education by offering an immersive, hands-on experience that is both accessible and engaging.

ABSTRACT

         The AR Eco Park project leverages marker-based AR technology to create an interactive educational tool. Using predefined markers placed throughout an eco-park, in brochures, or in classrooms, the app displays 3D models and information on scanned objects, such as plants, animals, and sustainable technologies (e.g., solar panels or water recycling systems). This experience promotes user engagement and learning by offering an interactive, immersive exploration of biodiversity and conservation practices. With a focus on environmental education, this app is designed to appeal to students, nature enthusiasts, and visitors interested in sustainability..

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

Marker-Based Recognition: Utilize marker-based AR to recognize designated markers, triggering the display of 3D models and relevant information about plant species, wildlife, and eco-friendly installations.
Interactive 3D Models: Provide interactive 3D representations of flora, fauna, and sustainable technologies within the eco-park setting.
Enhanced Engagement for Learning: Offer an immersive educational experience targeted at schools, nature centers, and eco-tourism, appealing to students, educators, and eco-conscious visitors.
In-Depth Eco Education: Equip each marker-triggered model with information about the species’ ecological roles, conservation practices, and sustainable technologies, enhancing the app's educational value

HARDWARE & SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Hardware Requirements:
Mobile device with camera and AR compatibility
Printed or digital markers
Good lighting conditions for reliable marker detection
Software Requirements:
Operating system compatible with AR (Android/iOS)
AR development platform (e.g., MyWebAR or Unity with Vuforia) for marker-based AR
3D modeling software for creating plant, animal, and eco-tech models

EXISTING SYSTEM

Eco-Education Apps: Most existing apps offer general information on eco-friendly practices but lack interactive 3D AR models linked to specific markers or objects.
Marker-Based AR: Although marker-based AR is commonly used in museums or product demos, few applications use it to create interactive eco-park experiences with a focus on biodiversity and sustainability education.

DRAWBACKS

Limited interactivity in eco-education apps without AR features, making learning less engaging.
No integrated approach combining marker-based AR, 3D models, and comprehensive information on biodiversity and eco-friendly technology.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

Marker-Based AR: Each eco-park feature (e.g., specific plants, animals, or installations) is linked to a unique marker that, when scanned, reveals a 3D model and educational information.
Interactive Models with Sound: The AR models are accompanied by relevant sounds (e.g., bird calls, wind sounds) to enrich the immersive experience.
Educational Information: Provide extensive educational content about each species’ role in the ecosystem and descriptions of sustainable practices implemented in the eco-park.

ADVANTAGES

•Enhanced Learning Experience: The app offers an interactive and immersive way to learn about animals, making it ideal for educational use in schools, museums, and zoos.
•Engagement through AR: By using augmented reality, the app captures users' attention more effectively than traditional learning methods, making the experience memorable and engaging.
•Portable and Accessible: Available on mobile devices, the app is accessible anywhere, allowing users to learn about animals in various environments
•Real-Time Interaction: Users can interact with the 3D animal models, which can help deepen understanding and provide a hands-on approach to learning about animal.

PROJECT DESIGN

           The project design includes placing unique markers throughout an eco-park or educational space. Users scan these markers to trigger the AR experience, which includes a 3D model and related information on the subject matter. The user interface features a scan option and AR view, with sound playing automatically upon marker detection. This design ensures that the app provides an immersive experience that is both educational and engaging
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT

          This project will be implemented using a marker-based AR platform, such as Unity with Vuforia or MyWebAR. Each marker will be associated with a specific 3D model and content. Upon detecting a marker, the app will display the corresponding model and play associated sounds, providing an immersive educational experience. The user-friendly interface allows seamless navigation between scanning and AR views. Comprehensive testing will ensure the app operates smoothly before deployment on app stores
CONCLUSION   

         The AR Eco Park app offers a unique way to learn about the environment by integrating marker-based AR with interactive 3D models and educational content. This platform bridges the gap in existing eco-education tools by combining biodiversity information and eco-friendly technology in an engaging, immersive format. It provides an innovative solution for eco-education that is accessible, portable, and captivating..

FUTUREWORK
         Future development includes expanding the marker library to cover a wider variety of species and eco-friendly installations. Improvements in marker recognition for various lighting conditions and environments will enhance usability. Planned features include adding animations for 3D models (e.g., animals moving, plants swaying) and a social sharing option to promote eco-awareness. Integrating voice assistance for a hands-free experience will further improve user engagement.
